    📚Need of Object Oriented Programming  :>

    💥 There are many real life problems which can be solved by functional  programming approach.

    🚁 But it get's complicated to work with data.

    🎀 For example :> ,

            
            void _MyCityHotels{
            string _HotelNames
            int _Rooms
            }

            main ()
            {
                int Customer_Needs;
                string Customer_Choice_Hotel;

                if (Customer_Needs!=_Rooms)
                {
                    printf("!Alas, No results !");
                }
            }

            ❗ See how our code get lenghty and unmanagable after few addtions of lines and after a point it becomes mess.



    🧰 Object Oriented Programming has following concepts which we have to deal with >

        📗 Classes
        📃 Objetcs
        👪Inheritance
        👩‍👩‍👦‍👦Polymorphism
        🔒 Encapsulation
        🆎 Abstraction

    🏛️ Classes are group of variables and functions .

    ✍ Note :
                1️⃣ Variables declared inside a class are called DATA Members
                2️⃣ Functions declared inside a class are called Member Functions

                📛 Example

                 class School{

                     int _StudentCount; :bread:These are class variables
                     String _SchoolAddress;


                        void _Input () :bow_and_arrow: This is Member Function
                        {
                            cin >> _StudentCount;
                            cin >> _SchoolAddress;
                        }

                 }
